# DeathStranding-ProcessMitigation
Crash fix for Death Stranding via Process Mitigation on Windows 11

If you still crash there may be some things the script missed so you will need to go into windows defender exploit protection by searching "Exploit" in the start menu and override everything as Disabled for ds.exe in your Death Stranding folder.
